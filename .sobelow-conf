# Sobelow Security Configuration for ExZarr
#
# ExZarr is a data storage library for Zarr format arrays. All remaining warnings
# are low-confidence and expected for this type of library:
#
# - File Traversal warnings: ExZarr intentionally reads/writes files at user-specified paths
# - String.to_atom warnings: Codec/dtype names from a known, finite set are converted to atoms
# - Atom interpolation warnings: Configuration keys are converted to atoms during initialization
#
# See SECURITY.md for detailed security guidance and safe usage patterns.
